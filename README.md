# Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in predicting credit risk for loan applicants. The dataset used for this analysis contains various features related to loan applicants, such as loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, total debt, and loan status (0 for healthy loans and 1 for high-risk loans). The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify loans as either healthy or high-risk based on these features.

## Results

- **Accuracy Score**: The logistic regression model achieved an impressive accuracy score of 99%, indicating that it correctly classified loans in almost all cases.

- **Precision Score**: The precision score for predicting high-risk loans (class 1) is 0.85. This means that out of all the loans predicted as high-risk, 85% were actually high-risk loans, indicating a relatively low false positive rate.

- **Recall Score**: The recall score for predicting high-risk loans (class 1) is 0.89. This means that the model identified 89% of the actual high-risk loans, indicating a low false negative rate.

## Summary

The model we used to predict if a loan is risky or not worked really well. It got it right almost all the time, with a 99% accuracy score. When it said a loan is risky, it was right 85% of the time. And when it looked at risky loans, it found 89% of them, which is pretty good.

This means the model is great for figuring out if someone might not be able to pay back their loan. It helps the company make smart choices to avoid lending to people who might not pay them back. But remember, no model is perfect, and there's always some uncertainty. So, while this model is a strong tool, it's best to use it along with other methods and expert advice to make sure the lending decisions are as safe as possible.
